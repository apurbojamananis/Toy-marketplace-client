    "question": "What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?",
    "answer": "Access token and refresh token are commonly used in authentication systems. An access token is a credential that represents the authorization granted to the client to access protected resources. It typically has a short lifespan and is used for making authenticated requests. A refresh token, on the other hand, is a long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to reauthenticate. Refresh tokens are securely stored on the server-side and should not be accessible to the client directly. On the client-side, access tokens are usually stored in memory or browser storage (e.g., localStorage) for making API requests, and they need to be sent along with each request for authorization.",

    "question": "Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?",
    "answer": "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of database management systems. SQL databases are relational databases that use structured schemas and are based on tables, rows, and columns. They ensure data integrity and support powerful query languages. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that offer flexibility and scalability. They use various data models, such as key-value pairs, document stores, graph databases, and wide-column stores. NoSQL databases are suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, whereas SQL databases excel in complex relationships and structured data.",

    "question": "What is Express.js? What is Nest.js?",
    "answer": "Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalistic and flexible set of features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js allows developers to handle routes, middleware, and HTTP requests easily. It has a large ecosystem of plugins and libraries, making it highly extensible and customizable. Nest.js, on the other hand, is a progressive Node.js framework built with TypeScript. It is designed for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. Nest.js is heavily inspired by Angular and adopts its modular structure and decorators for creating robust and enterprise-grade applications. It incorporates features like dependency injection, decorators, and a powerful CLI.",

    "question": "What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?",
    "answer": "MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool used for processing and transforming data within the database. It allows developers to perform advanced data manipulations, such as filtering, grouping, sorting, joining, and computing aggregate functions. The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB consists of multiple stages that process documents sequentially. Each stage performs a specific operation on the data and passes the result to the next stage. Examples of stages include `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$project`, and `$lookup`. The aggregation framework provides a flexible and efficient way to perform complex data analysis and reporting tasks within MongoDB.",
